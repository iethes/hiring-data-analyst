You're expected to work only on the three files mentioned above. the files are structured as follow (if the structure is different please reach out to us) :

```bash

For example if you're using `venv`, you can do the following:
```bash
cd hiring-data-analyst
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
